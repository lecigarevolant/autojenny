Keep in mind that you are Ken Jennings-level with trivia, and Mensa-level with puzzles, so there should be a deep well to draw from.

Here is the request:

{task}

Here is the pre-survey:

    1. Please list any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. It is possible that there are none.
    2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
    3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation)
    4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.

When answering this survey, keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc. Your answer should use headings:

    1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
    2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
    3. FACTS TO DERIVE
    4. EDUCATED GUESSES

DO NOT include any other headings or sections in your response. DO NOT list next steps or plans until asked to do so.

Based on the team composition, and known and unknown facts, please devise a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request. Remember, there is no requirement to involve all team members -- a team member's particular expertise may not be needed for this task."""

To answer this request we have assembled the following team:

Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:

Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:

{plan}

IMPORTANT: When working with files in the Executor, use paths relative to the working directory. For example, if a file is in 'browser_data/downloads/file.csv', use that path directly without any prefix.

ORCHESTRATOR_PROGRESS_LEDGER_PROMPT = """
Recall we are working on the following request:

{task}

And we have assembled the following team:

{team}

IMPORTANT: When selecting the Executor as the next speaker, your instruction MUST include the complete code to run in a markdown code block (```python or ```sh), even if this code was mentioned in previous messages. Never ask the Executor to "re-run" or "execute previous code" without including the full code block.
IMPORTANT: The WebSurfer is responsible for downloading files. It should be explicitly instructed to download files.
IMPORTANT: When working with files in the Executor, use paths relative to the working directory. For example, if a file is in 'browser_data/downloads/file.csv', use that path directly without any prefix.

To make progress on the request, please answer the following questions, including necessary reasoning:

    - Is the request fully satisfied? (True if complete, or False if the original request has yet to be SUCCESSFULLY and FULLY addressed)
    - Are we in a loop where we are repeating the same requests and / or getting the same responses as before? Loops can span multiple turns, and can include repeated actions like scrolling up or down more than a handful of times. Do consider that for WebSurfer, it can take several turns to explore a site.
    - Are we making forward progress? (True if just starting, or recent messages are adding value. False if recent messages show evidence of being stuck or if there is evidence of significant barriers to success such as the inability to read from a required file)
    - Who should speak next? (select from: {names})
    - What instruction or question would you give this team member? (Phrase as if speaking directly to them. If selecting the Executor, you MUST include the complete code block to execute, even if previously mentioned)

Please output an answer in pure JSON format according to the following schema. The JSON object must be parsable as-is. DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN JSON, AND DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS SCHEMA:

It's clear we aren't making as much progress as we would like, but we may have learned something new. Please rewrite the following fact sheet, updating it to include anything new we have learned that may be helpful. Example edits can include (but are not limited to) adding new guesses, moving educated guesses to verified facts if appropriate, etc. Updates may be made to any section of the fact sheet, and more than one section of the fact sheet can be edited. This is an especially good time to update educated guesses, so please at least add or update one educated guess or hunch, and explain your reasoning.
